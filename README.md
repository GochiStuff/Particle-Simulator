trying to make a simple particle simulator , with an approch to make realisic physical interactions. 

for now , aiming to have properly working 
1. Particle collision and efficent handelling of large number of particles .
2. Intra particle forces.
3. coeff of restitution
4. drag || affects of diff air density
5. gravity



For collision , Source
